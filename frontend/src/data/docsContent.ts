      "Initialize a new Git repository in your project directory to start version control and track changes.",
    overview:
      "The git init command creates a new Git repository in the current directory. It initializes version control by creating a hidden .git subdirectory that contains all the necessary repository metadata and object database. This is the first command you run when starting a new project with Git.",
    detailedExplanation: [
      "When you execute git init, Git creates a .git directory in your current folder. This hidden directory contains all the internal data structures needed for version control, including the objects database, refs (references to commits and branches), configuration files, and hooks.",
      "The .git directory is what makes a folder a Git repository. Without it, Git commands won't work in that directory. This directory stores the complete history of your project, all commits, branches, tags, and configuration settings.",
      "By default, git init creates a repository with an initial branch (typically named 'main' or 'master' depending on your Git configuration). However, no commits exist yet - you need to add files and make your first commit to actually start tracking changes.",
      "You can also use git init with a directory name to create a new directory and initialize Git in it simultaneously. Additionally, the --initial-branch flag allows you to specify a custom name for the default branch.",

    keyTakeaways: [
      "git init only needs to be run once per project",
      "The .git directory contains all version control data - never delete it",
      "No commits exist immediately after init - you must add and commit files",
      "You can initialize Git in an existing project with files already present",

It also automatically sets up a connection to the original repository, allowing you to push and pull changes.",
    detailedExplanation: [
      "When you clone a repository, Git downloads every version of every file in the project's history. This means you get a full-fledged Git repository with complete version control capabilities, not just a snapshot of the latest files.",
      "The clone command automatically creates a remote connection named 'origin' that points to the source repository. This makes it easy to fetch updates and push your changes back to the remote.",
      "By default, git clone creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. It initializes a .git directory inside it, checks out the default branch (usually 'main' or 'master'), and sets up remote tracking branches.",
      "You can clone repositories using HTTPS URLs or SSH URLs. HTTPS is simpler for public repositories, while SSH is preferred for private repositories and when you want to avoid entering credentials repeatedly.",

      "Clone creates a complete copy with full version history",
      "The remote repository is automatically set up as 'origin'",
      "All branches are downloaded but only default branch is checked out",
      "HTTPS urls work for everyone but may require credentials",
      "SSH urls require SSH key setup but are more convenient for private repos",

      "Check the current state of your repository including staged, unstaged, and untracked files.",
    overview:
      "The git status command displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It shows which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is one of the most frequently used Git commands and should be run often to understand what's happening in your repository.",
    detailedExplanation: [
      "Git status provides a comprehensive view of your repository's current state. It divides files into three categories: staged (green), modified but unstaged (red), and untracked (red). Understanding these categories is essential for effective Git workflow.",
      "Staged files are changes you've added with 'git add' and are ready to be committed. Modified files are tracked files with changes that haven't been staged yet. Untracked files are new files that Git isn't monitoring yet.",
      "The command also shows which branch you're currently on and whether your branch is ahead, behind, or in sync with the remote branch. This helps you know if you need to push, pull, or if you're up to date.",
      "Git status is completely safe to run at any time - it never modifies your repository, only shows information. Running it frequently is considered a best practice to stay aware of your repository's state.",

    detailedExplanation: [
      "Git uses a three-stage process: working directory (where you edit files), staging area (where you prepare commits), and repository (where commits are stored). The git add command moves changes from the working directory to the staging area.",
      "You can be selective about what you stage. You can add specific files, directories, or even specific parts of files. This allows you to create focused, logical commits even when you've made many different changes.",
      "When you add a file, Git creates a snapshot of its current content. If you modify the file after adding it but before committing, those new changes won't be included in the commit unless you run git add again.",

      "Understanding git log is crucial for navigating your project's history. It helps you find when bugs were introduced, understand why changes were made, and identify which commit you need to checkout, revert, or cherry-pick.",
      "The log shows the history from HEAD (current commit) backward through the parent commits. If you're on a branch, you see that branch's history. To see other branches, you need to specify them or use --all.",

    overview:
      "Branching is one of Git's most powerful features. Creating a branch allows you to diverge from the main line of development and work independently without affecting other branches. Each branch is essentially a lightweight movable pointer to a commit, making branching fast and efficient in Git.",
    detailedExplanation: [
      "When you create a branch, Git creates a new pointer to the current commit you're on. Unlike other version control systems, Git doesn't create a full copy of your files - it just creates a new pointer. This makes branching extremely cheap and fast.",
      "Branches are typically used for developing new features, fixing bugs, or experimenting with ideas. The main principle is to keep your main branch (usually 'main' or 'master') stable and production-ready, while doing all development work in separate branches.",
      "After creating a branch, you can switch to it and make commits. These commits will only exist on that branch until you merge them into another branch. This isolation allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other.",
      "Modern Git (2.23+) introduced 'git switch' as a clearer alternative to 'git checkout' for branch operations. Both commands work, but 'git switch' is more intuitive and focused solely on branch switching.",

      "There are two main types of merges: fast-forward merges and three-way merges (also called merge commits). A fast-forward merge happens when there's a linear path from the current branch to the target branch - Git just moves the pointer forward. A three-way merge is needed when both branches have diverged and have unique commits.",
      "During a merge, Git automatically combines changes from both branches. If the same part of a file was modified differently in both branches, you'll get a merge conflict that needs manual resolution. Git is remarkably good at auto-merging changes when they don't conflict.",
